# Persistent Homology Examples

This repo exists to hold interactive html widgets referenced in my [Towards Data Science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/persistent-homology-with-examples-1974d4b9c3d0).

Unfortunately, I cannot share code, as that belongs to my employer (Geometric Data Analytics). I can say that all the code is Python.

The Persistent Homology Calculations were done using my employer's open source Topological Data Analysis package `gda-public`, which is available [here](https://github.com/geomdata/gda-public).

All my visualizations were generated using `matplotlib` and `holoviews`.

# 0d Persistent Homology Example

In the article, I include a gif showing connected components, with each color representing a unique component at a given threshold:

<center>
<img src="0d_disks_components.gif" width="80%">
</center>

The widget referenced below allows you to see the thresholds covered in the gif, but with interactive control of the threshold:

# 1d Persistent Homology Example

In the article, I include a gif showing 1d persistence values for a noisy circle of data:

<center>
<img src="1d_disks.gif" width="80%">
</center>

The widget referenced below allows you to see the thresholds covered in the gif, but with interactive control of the threshold:

# Signal Compression Example

In the article, I include a gif showing the progressively more strict compression of a random walk:

<center>
<img src="compressed_signal.gif" width="80%">
</center>

The widget referenced below allows you to see the thresholds covered in the gif, but with interactive control of the threshold:

# Height Filtration Segmentation Example

In the article, I include a static image from running the height filtration up to a specified threshold:

<center>
<img src="segmentation_coverage.png" width="50%">
</center>

The widget referenced below allows you to see the connected components that form running the height filtration to aribtrary values:
