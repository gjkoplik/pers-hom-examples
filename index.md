# Persistent Homology Placeholder

This repo exists to hold interactive html widgets related to my Towards Data Science Medium article.

Unfortunately, I cannot share code, as that belongs to my employer (Geometric Data Analytics). I can say that all code to create the visualizations in my article was in Python.

The Persistent Homology Calculations were done using an open source Topological Data Analysis package called `gda-public`, which is available [here](https://github.com/geomdata/gda-public).

All my visualizations were generated using `matplotlib` or `holoviews`.

# Height Filtration Segmentation Example

This widget allows you to see the connected components that form running the height filtration to aribtrary values:
