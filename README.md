# Persistent Homology Examples

This repo exists to hold interactive html widgets referenced in my Towards Data Science Medium article.

Unfortunately, I cannot share code, as that belongs to my employer (Geometric Data Analytics). I can say that all the code is Python.

The Persistent Homology Calculations were done using my employer's open source Topological Data Analysis package `gda-public`, which is available [here](https://github.com/geomdata/gda-public).

All my visualizations were generated using `matplotlib` and `holoviews`.
